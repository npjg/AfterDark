The smell of toasters is again in the air!

This project aims to provide a framework for parsing
resources in After Dark modules. 

Since After Dark modules are native executable images on their 
respective platforms, analyzing the _behavior_ of the modules 
requires a decompiler. But the module's resources are usually
stored in some standardized format, so they can be extracted
and parsed.

==Supported Engines==
 * 16-bit Windows (After Dark for Windows 1.0 - 3.0)

More supported engines on the way!
